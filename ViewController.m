However, for a number of reasons, most countries have chosen to treat all data subjects equally, regardless of nationality or source of data flow.93 There are moral reasons, in my opinion, but also very practical ones: in many cases, it could be difficult or impossible to determine the nationality of a data subject whose data is being automatically pro- cessed; it could be costly for data controllers to implement systems that differentiate between data subjects; and it could be difficult to enforce such a regime.94 Taking heed of these facts, the MDPC applies to all data subjects regardless of nationality. The statutes and the common law also generally protect subjects without regard to nationality";

Thus it is possible to entertain the thought that the National Trust Council accredi- tation scheme, which only applies to those organisations that voluntarily subscribe to it, could ask for a positive finding from the EU Commission even if the rest of Singapore could not meet the standard. In this case, the free flow of information from the EU would apply only to the organisations participating in the scheme.";
